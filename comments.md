Some considerations:

Notebook synchronization and reload: In practice, managing real-time updates and ensuring seamless live notebook reloads through the REST API could introduce latency or complexity. It will likely require careful testing and iteration to get a smooth user experience.

XHTML log scalability: Maintaining a single, ever-growing XHTML log file might become cumbersome in very long sessions. The planned "log roll" is a good mitigation strategy, but frequent summaries might be required to maintain responsiveness and clarity.

User acceptance and experience: Researchers comfortable with Jupyter will appreciate the minimal overhead and transparency. However, the effectiveness depends heavily on crafting good prompts and LLM interactions. Significant effort may be needed upfront to perfect prompt engineering for stable, predictable outcomes.

Prompt complexity and maintenance: While a few thousand tokens of prompts strike a good balance, youâ€™ll need a thoughtful strategy for prompt organization and maintainability, especially as you scale up functionality.

Error handling and reversibility: Making notebook edits easy to reverse or audit will be critical for user trust. Incorporating a clear mechanism for rolling back or selectively accepting LLM-generated edits would strongly enhance usability.
