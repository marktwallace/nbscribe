## Phase 1: Environment Setup

### Commands to run:
```bash
cd /Users/mark.wallace/src/nbscribe
conda activate nbscribe
python main.py
```

### ‚úÖ Results:

**Notes:**

---

## Phase 2: Create Test Notebook

### Steps:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5317
2. Click "Create New Notebook" or use interface to create notebook
3. Name it `test_notebook.ipynb`
4. Manually add these cells in Jupyter:
   - **Cell 1**: `import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np`
   - **Cell 2**: `df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")\nprint(df.head())`
5. Save the notebook (Ctrl+S in Jupyter)

### ‚úÖ Results:
- [ ] Notebook created successfully
- [ ] Both cells added and saved
- [ ] Can see notebook in file listing

**Notes:**

---

## Phase 3: Cell ID Analysis (Exit & Restart Test)

### Steps:
1. Exit nbscribe server (Ctrl+C)
2. Open `test_notebook.ipynb` in text editor
3. Look for `"metadata": {"id": "..."}` in each cell
4. Record the cell IDs for reference
5. Restart nbscribe: `python main.py`
6. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5317/notebook/test_notebook.ipynb`

### ‚úÖ Results:
- [ ] Cell IDs were automatically added to JSON

- [ ] Cell contains matplotlib import

**Directive Generated:**

**Notes:**

### Test 5.2: Insert AFTER Existing Cell  
**Ask AI:** "Add a data analysis cell after the data loading cell"

### ‚úÖ Expected:
- AI uses `AFTER: [actual-cell-id]` with Cell 2's ID

### ‚úÖ Results:
- [ ] AI used correct AFTER positioning
- [ ] AI referenced correct cell ID
- [ ] Cell inserted in right location

**Directive Generated:**

**Notes:**

### Test 5.3: Insert BEFORE Existing Cell
**Ask AI:** "Add a data cleaning step before the analysis cell"

### ‚úÖ Expected:
- AI uses `BEFORE: [cell-id]` with analysis cell ID  
- New cell appears in correct position

### ‚úÖ Results:
- [ ] AI used correct BEFORE positioning
- [ ] Cell inserted in right location

**Directive Generated:**

**Notes:**

---

## Phase 6: Cell Editing Tests

### Test 6.1: Edit Existing Cell
**Ask AI:** "Change the first cell to also import seaborn"

### ‚úÖ Expected:
- AI suggests `TOOL: edit_cell` with correct `CELL_ID`
- Apply updates cell content
- Cell outputs are cleared

### ‚úÖ Results:
- [ ] AI identified correct cell to edit
- [ ] Edit applied successfully
- [ ] Content updated in Jupyter
- [ ] Outputs cleared

**Directive Generated:**

**Notes:**

### Test 6.2: Edit Non-Existent Cell (Error Test)
Create this directive manually in chat:

```python
print("test")
```

```
TOOL: edit_cell
CELL_ID: fake-cell-123
```

### ‚úÖ Expected:
- Error message: "Cell ID 'fake-cell-123' not found"
- No notebook corruption

### ‚úÖ Results:
- [ ] Appropriate error message shown
- [ ] Notebook remained intact

**Error Message:**

**Notes:**

---

## Phase 7: Cell Deletion Tests

### Test 7.1: Delete Existing Cell
**Ask AI:** "Remove the data loading cell"

### ‚úÖ Expected:
- AI suggests `delete_cell` with correct cell ID
- Cell disappears from notebook

### ‚úÖ Results:
- [ ] AI identified correct cell
- [ ] Cell deleted successfully
- [ ] Notebook structure updated

**Directive Generated:**

**Notes:**

---

## Phase 8: Empty Notebook Test

### Steps:
1. Create new empty notebook: `empty_test.ipynb`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5317/notebook/empty_test.ipynb`
3. **Ask AI:** "Add the first cell to import pandas"

### ‚úÖ Expected:
- AI uses `POS: 0` for empty notebook
- Cell insertion works correctly

### ‚úÖ Results:
- [ ] AI handled empty notebook correctly
- [ ] Used POS positioning as fallback
- [ ] First cell created successfully

### ‚úÖ Expected:
- AI mentions no notebook is open
- Directives fail gracefully

### ‚úÖ Results:
