This is a new project. Let's start by creating a markdown document for a project plan, with some initial tasks and checkboxes for progress. Start lightweight: our first goal is to get a good starting point and have some working code so we can start learning. We can fill in more detail on the project plan after some proof of concept.

Assistant:
I've created a lightweight project-plan.md that breaks down the work into actionable tasks with checkboxes. This complements your existing detailed README.md by focusing on getting a proof of concept working quickly.
The plan is organized into two phases:
Phase 1: Proof of Concept - Basic functionality to start learning and iterating
Phase 2: Enhanced Features - After the POC is working
Key features of this task-oriented approach:
‚úÖ Clear checkboxes for tracking progress
üéØ Focused on getting working code quickly
üìù Organized by functional areas (Infrastructure, LLM Integration, etc.)
üöÄ Simple getting started commands
‚ú® Success criteria to know when Phase 1 is complete
The plan emphasizes "keep it simple, get it working, then iterate" - perfect for starting to learn about the domain and building momentum. You can start checking off boxes as you make progress!
Would you like to start working on any of these tasks, or would you like me to adjust the plan in any way?

User:
OK, great. Let's start by implementing everything up to the health check, then testing. I will lead in the testing: suggest, but do not issue testing commands.

Assistant:

Perfect! Let's start implementing the core infrastructure. I'll create the dependencies file and basic FastAPI server with static file serving and a health check endpoint.
...

User:
OK, before testing, a couple of changes: lets put the source code in a /src dir, with a main.py in root. In addition to requirements. I'm using a conda style environment.yml file. My FastAPI stuff usually is not Conda, but this is all about Jupyter, where Conda shines.

Assistant:
Great idea! Conda makes perfect sense for a Jupyter-focused project. Let me restructure the project with a /src directory and create a conda environment.yml file.
...
# Create and activate conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate nbscribe

# Start the server (from project root)
python main.py

# In another terminal (with nbscribe env activated), test endpoints:
curl http://localhost:5317/health
curl http://localhost:5317/api/info
curl -X POST http://localhost:5317/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello from conda!"}'

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:5317
