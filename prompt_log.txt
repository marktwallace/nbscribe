This is a new project. Let's start by creating a markdown document for a project plan, with some initial tasks and checkboxes for progress. Start lightweight: our first goal is to get a good starting point and have some working code so we can start learning. We can fill in more detail on the project plan after some proof of concept.

Assistant:
I've created a lightweight project-plan.md that breaks down the work into actionable tasks with checkboxes. This complements your existing detailed README.md by focusing on getting a proof of concept working quickly.
The plan is organized into two phases:
Phase 1: Proof of Concept - Basic functionality to start learning and iterating
Phase 2: Enhanced Features - After the POC is working
Key features of this task-oriented approach:
‚úÖ Clear checkboxes for tracking progress
üéØ Focused on getting working code quickly
üìù Organized by functional areas (Infrastructure, LLM Integration, etc.)
üöÄ Simple getting started commands
‚ú® Success criteria to know when Phase 1 is complete
The plan emphasizes "keep it simple, get it working, then iterate" - perfect for starting to learn about the domain and building momentum. You can start checking off boxes as you make progress!
Would you like to start working on any of these tasks, or would you like me to adjust the plan in any way?

User:
OK, great. Let's start by implementing everything up to the health check, then testing. I will lead in the testing: suggest, but do not issue testing commands.

Assistant:

Perfect! Let's start implementing the core infrastructure. I'll create the dependencies file and basic FastAPI server with static file serving and a health check endpoint.
...

User:
OK, before testing, a couple of changes: lets put the source code in a /src dir, with a main.py in root. In addition to requirements. I'm using a conda style environment.yml file. My FastAPI stuff usually is not Conda, but this is all about Jupyter, where Conda shines.

Assistant:
Great idea! Conda makes perfect sense for a Jupyter-focused project. Let me restructure the project with a /src directory and create a conda environment.yml file.
...
# Create and activate conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate nbscribe

# Start the server (from project root)
python main.py

# In another terminal (with nbscribe env activated), test endpoints:
curl http://localhost:5317/health
curl http://localhost:5317/api/info
curl -X POST http://localhost:5317/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello from conda!"}'

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:5317

... we worked through the project plan for a while, then I "make" it ask me questions

OK, let's get this straight. My OPENAI_API_KEY is in my env, it will not be in this project directory, but you can assume it exists. Maybe we should add and example env file that get loaded for documentation purposes? What is the most typical way top explain to users in a READMO fro providing an API key? I would like to model it on popular projects so it is predicatble. Are there any other open questions before doing LLM integration?

Assistant:
...it asks a bunch of questions, then I answer them all...

1. Let do langchain from the beginning. It sets us up to be vendor neutral. But I do not want to use many of langchains features -- mostly just connection -- I do not want it tracking my context, since we will do that in the live xhtml doc as described in the design. *No hidden state, anywhere*

2. gpt-4.1 is the model we will use

3. start with Simple text responses

4. No hidden state -- the XHTML file will be the bases of our context -- all content in there (not display logic) get sent. When we need to sumerize the file, we "roll" it to a log directory. For now, the memory is just the history, but when we "roll" to another log file we need to summerize the previous conversation and that becomes memory. We may in the future create "project memories" and if we do, they should be explicit is a user visible and editable file. We will do sumrization and possible memories in the future. They can be added to the plan, but no code yet.

5. I do not like "fallbacks" -- fail early and often. No rate limiting at all -- this is single user. Error logging should be complete, including stack traces.

6. Start with prompt file loading. The file that is loaded from /prompts can be basic, for now.

Assistant:
Excellent! Very clear requirements. I love the "no hidden state" principle - everything should be explicit and user-visible. Let me implement LLM integration with these exact specifications.

OK, this is working as expected now. I want to clear some cruft before moving to notebook integration. First, lets get rid of the text in the xhtml that is after the form with the "send". Then, lets adjuat this to be more optimal to the "live" xhtml document concept. That means that static parts of the xhtml doc shoul be included were we can. like Javascript, CSS, and any boiler plate or common features that need to be in every xhtml "conversation log" -- we want the file to be a tight log of the content of the interaction. I think this means that we are reordering our plan to work on the chat log system some more before moving to notebook integration.

Assistant:

OK, I agree with your conclusion. I have suggestions for readabilty. Can the document still be valid xhtml if we use more natural and compact element names, like:
<msg role="User">
   -- content here --
</msg>
I do not actually remember how flexible xhtml is, but I would like brevity and readablity if we can get w/o too much hacking.

OK, bookmarks and browser history are working. I like the session_id with the date-time in it. The file size is good and the file is readable. The greeting refreshes as expected. The session id works to retrieve any conversataion in the log, which is great. Everything is super fast.

Lets make the UX better by streaming back the AI completions. Of course this should not break anything with session continuity, but I do expect that a refresh will stop the streaming. When the reponse is complte it should update the logfile. I could see a potential UX hiccup is user refresh while they are waiting for AI reponses. We could either say "don't do that" or maybe be reallt clever somehow, but I want the code to stay relatively simple.
