This is a new project. Let's start by creating a markdown document for a project plan, with some initial tasks and checkboxes for progress. Start lightweight: our first goal is to get a good starting point and have some working code so we can start learning. We can fill in more detail on the project plan after some proof of concept.

Assistant:
I've created a lightweight project-plan.md that breaks down the work into actionable tasks with checkboxes. This complements your existing detailed README.md by focusing on getting a proof of concept working quickly.
The plan is organized into two phases:
Phase 1: Proof of Concept - Basic functionality to start learning and iterating
Phase 2: Enhanced Features - After the POC is working
Key features of this task-oriented approach:
‚úÖ Clear checkboxes for tracking progress
üéØ Focused on getting working code quickly
üìù Organized by functional areas (Infrastructure, LLM Integration, etc.)
üöÄ Simple getting started commands
‚ú® Success criteria to know when Phase 1 is complete
The plan emphasizes "keep it simple, get it working, then iterate" - perfect for starting to learn about the domain and building momentum. You can start checking off boxes as you make progress!
Would you like to start working on any of these tasks, or would you like me to adjust the plan in any way?

User:
OK, great. Let's start by implementing everything up to the health check, then testing. I will lead in the testing: suggest, but do not issue testing commands.

Assistant:

Perfect! Let's start implementing the core infrastructure. I'll create the dependencies file and basic FastAPI server with static file serving and a health check endpoint.
...

User:
OK, before testing, a couple of changes: lets put the source code in a /src dir, with a main.py in root. In addition to requirements. I'm using a conda style environment.yml file. My FastAPI stuff usually is not Conda, but this is all about Jupyter, where Conda shines.

Assistant:
Great idea! Conda makes perfect sense for a Jupyter-focused project. Let me restructure the project with a /src directory and create a conda environment.yml file.
...
# Create and activate conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate nbscribe

# Start the server (from project root)
python main.py

# In another terminal (with nbscribe env activated), test endpoints:
curl http://localhost:5317/health
curl http://localhost:5317/api/info
curl -X POST http://localhost:5317/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello from conda!"}'

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:5317

... we worked through the project plan for a while, then I "make" it ask me questions

OK, let's get this straight. My OPENAI_API_KEY is in my env, it will not be in this project directory, but you can assume it exists. Maybe we should add and example env file that get loaded for documentation purposes? What is the most typical way top explain to users in a READMO fro providing an API key? I would like to model it on popular projects so it is predicatble. Are there any other open questions before doing LLM integration?

Assistant:
...it asks a bunch of questions, then I answer them all...

Answers:
1. Let do langchain from the beginning. It sets us up to be vendor neutral. But I do not want to use many of langchains features -- mostly just connection -- I do not want it tracking my context, since we will do that in the live xhtml doc as described in the design. *No hidden state, anywhere*

2. gpt-4.1 is the model we will use

3. start with Simple text responses

4. No hidden state -- the XHTML file will be the bases of our context -- all content in there (not display logic) get sent. When we need to sumerize the file, we "roll" it to a log directory. For now, the memory is just the history, but when we "roll" to another log file we need to summerize the previous conversation and that becomes memory. We may in the future create "project memories" and if we do, they should be explicit is a user visible and editable file. We will do sumrization and possible memories in the future. They can be added to the plan, but no code yet.

5. I do not like "fallbacks" -- fail early and often. No rate limiting at all -- this is single user. Error logging should be complete, including stack traces.

6. Start with prompt file loading. The file that is loaded from /prompts can be basic, for now.

Assistant:
Excellent! Very clear requirements. I love the "no hidden state" principle - everything should be explicit and user-visible. Let me implement LLM integration with these exact specifications.

OK, this is working as expected now. I want to clear some cruft before moving to notebook integration. First, lets get rid of the text in the xhtml that is after the form with the "send". Then, lets adjuat this to be more optimal to the "live" xhtml document concept. That means that static parts of the xhtml doc shoul be included were we can. like Javascript, CSS, and any boiler plate or common features that need to be in every xhtml "conversation log" -- we want the file to be a tight log of the content of the interaction. I think this means that we are reordering our plan to work on the chat log system some more before moving to notebook integration.

Assistant:

User:
...
OK, I agree with your conclusion. I have suggestions for readabilty. Can the document still be valid xhtml if we use more natural and compact element names, like:
<msg role="User">
   -- content here --
</msg>
I do not actually remember how flexible xhtml is, but I would like brevity and readablity if we can get w/o too much hacking.

Assistant:

User:

OK, bookmarks and browser history are working. I like the session_id with the date-time in it. The file size is good and the file is readable. The greeting refreshes as expected. The session id works to retrieve any conversataion in the log, which is great. Everything is super fast.

Lets make the UX better by streaming back the AI completions. Of course this should not break anything with session continuity, but I do expect that a refresh will stop the streaming. When the reponse is complte it should update the logfile. I could see a potential UX hiccup is user refresh while they are waiting for AI reponses. We could either say "don't do that" or maybe be reallt clever somehow, but I want the code to stay relatively simple.

Before I test this, tell me how it works.

If I press "send" the jaascript on the page should send an AJAX request to the Python server, right? Then the Python server should construct a prompt for the AI, and send it to the OpenAI endpoint with langchain, right? The prompt should be derived from the conversation log. Is that the way it is working right now?

So what part is streaming? Does the server make a request and then get the completion streamed back from OpenAI? Then does the Python server stream it bck to the Javascript on the page?

Assistant:
...lots of work for hours...

OK, the chat system is in OK shape now. Let's move on to notebook integration. We should start by making sure we have an understandable design and we both know what to do next. No coding yet.

Assistant:
  Great! Let's step back and design the notebook integration properly before diving into code. Looking at the current project plan, the notebook section is quite sparse and doesn't capture the real design challenges.
Key Design Questions
Let me first understand what we're building:
What's the core user workflow?
User chats with AI about their notebook
AI can read/analyze notebooks
AI can suggest or make changes to notebooks
But how does this actually work in practice?
What notebook operations should we support?
Read existing notebooks and analyze content
Add new cells (code, markdown, raw)
Modify existing cells
Execute cells? (or just edit)
Create new notebooks from scratch
How does this integrate with the chat interface?
Does the user specify a notebook file in chat?
Does the AI automatically detect notebook files in the directory?
How does the user review/approve changes before they're applied?
What's the UX flow?
Chat-driven: "Add a cell that loads pandas"
File-based: AI operates on specified notebook files
Preview-first: Show proposed changes before applying
Direct manipulation: AI makes changes immediately
Current Understanding
From the project name "nbscribe" and description, it seems like:
nbscribe = notebook + scribe (someone who writes/edits documents)
AI acts as an intelligent editor for Jupyter notebooks
Chat interface is the control mechanism
What specific design approach do you have in mind for the notebook integration?
I'd like to understand your vision before proposing a detailed design. Are you thinking:
AI suggests notebook edits through chat, user approves them?
AI directly modifies notebooks based on chat requests?
Something else entirely?
This will help me propose a clear architecture that matches your goals.

OK, I tried to evaluate Jupyter AI but I esatblished that it is mostly AWS demo-ware at the moment and broken on any platforms I could use for testing.

Assistant:
Excellent design! This is a much more sophisticated and practical approach than trying to compete with Jupyter AI. The subprocess + REST API strategy elegantly solves the file conflict issues we discussed, and the structured tool directive format is brilliant.
Review Questions & Observations
Strong Design Decisions ‚úÖ
Subprocess approach - Eliminates file locking issues entirely
Approval-gated AI - Much safer than auto-execution
Markdown audit logs - Git-friendly and human-readable
Structured tool syntax - Deterministic and extensible
Split-pane UI - Natural workflow integration
Clarification Questions
1. Multi-notebook workflow
How does the user switch between notebooks in the left pane?
Does nbscribe manage multiple Notebook 7 sessions, or one shared session?
2. Cell execution handling
I see execute_cell in the API but not in the AI tool format examples
Should AI be able to propose cell execution, or just editing?
Format would be: TOOL: execute_cell, CELL_ID: 3?
3. Operational concerns
Port conflicts: What if 8889 is taken? Auto-discover free port?
Server lifecycle: Graceful shutdown, restart on crash?
Performance: Is full Notebook 7 overkill vs lighter nbformat + kernel management?
4. Concurrent editing edge cases
User manually edits cell while AI approval is pending?
Cell positions shift due to manual insertions/deletions?
5. System prompt design
What's the LLM system prompt to generate proper tool syntax?
How do we ensure it uses tools appropriately vs just generating code?
Implementation Priority
The delta.md task list looks right. I'd suggest this order:
Subprocess + proxy (core infrastructure)
Split-pane UI (user can see both panels)
Tool directive parser + approval buttons
REST endpoints for notebook modification
Audit logging integration
If these questions have reasonable answers, this design is ready to implement. The approach is innovative and addresses real gaps in the Jupyter ecosystem.
Should I proceed with updating the project plan based on delta.md?

Answers:
1. To start with, I think having one notebook is best for now. We would have to switch out the AI context completely when switching notebook to avoid confusing the AI, so I do not see much benifit to building a switched until after we have good POC. So one session, too.
2. We could skip execution for now. I don't think it helps the human much, and it might confuse them. Although maybe "edit" and "execute" would be good buttons to include in the chat panel. It occurs to me the for the human, having the buttons (and thus the TOOL block) below the source  code would be more convenient than above the source code -- less scolling.
3. Auto-discover free port is OK, I think, because the this a subprocess completely under the control of nbscribe. 
For now, just crash until we figure out error patterns.
The idea of Notebook 7 is to control the UX in a positive way. Othewise the user has to orchestrate everything to work together, right?
4. User aces out AI -- that is a PITA. Maybe figure it out after the POC? AI would overwrite user typing which sucks.
5. I have a proposed system prompt which we will adjust based on implementation.

Parsing Questions:
Blockquote format: Should it be exactly > **Cell Edit Proposal** or any blockquote with TOOL:?
Metadata parsing: For POS: 3, should we also support:
CELL_ID: abc123 (for edits)
TYPE: code or TYPE: markdown (cell types)
Code block proximity: Must the Python code block be immediately after the TOOL directive, or can there be text in between?
Error handling: What if TOOL directive is malformed? Show buttons anyway or ignore?

User:
Answers:
1. Let's remove extra stuff unless it is really needed by the AI or human, so we will drop **Cell Edit Proposal**
I would go farther, and remove all the leading > characters, too. They made sense when we were discussing it, to avoid mixing up markdown editors, but I think they would just confuse the AI to try and emit those leading characters before each line of python code.
2. Let's support CELL_ID, too. I am not sure which will be easier for the AI agent, and we can try system prompt with either convention.
3. To be clear: the TOOL directive should be immeaditely below the code block, not above. So when a code block, python or markup, is encountered, the line right after should be TOOL.
4. Malformed directive is an interesting problem. Better to squawk about it actually, because the system prompt needs to be clear about it, and an LLM that cannot handle it reliably is probably not approriate for use with nbscribe.

‚ùì Key Questions:
Terminals: Do we want users to have browser terminal access, or should they use system terminal?
File watching: Should Jupyter auto-reload if files change externally, or do we control all changes?
Multiple kernels: Should users be able to run multiple notebooks simultaneously, or one at a time?
Kernel lifecycle: Should kernels stay alive between notebook sessions, or restart fresh each time?

User:
Answers:
1. The philosophy of this project is to do everything in the open, no hidden state, and both the human and the AI see the complete record. At the moment, I cannot think of an elegant way to include a full featured terminal from that POV -- we could spend all our project effort on giving the AI reasonable visiblity into a terminal and still not solve a problem that big.
2. For the puposes of this project, only the user in Jupyter modifying the file, and the AI only reads an modifies the file as part of a completion cycle initiated by the user: when the user submits, the AI reads the .ipynb and then modifies it once when the completion comes back from the AI. So the AI's edits happen at a ompletely predicatble time. So no watching, afaict.
3. One at a time.
4. Restart fresh. The AI needs to see what is happening and won't remember where they left it the way a human would.
